 BAIS:3300 homework 9 survey

 Ellie Goodman Homework 9 Responses

 Part A: This assignment required us to create a survey for Business Analytics students to take regarding where they are from, how they identify, and their progress and feelings towards being a BAIS major.
 Part B: I allowed students to chose that they decline to share any personal information. Because some students may not feel comfortable stating their gender or pronouns, they have the option to opt out of this question if they feel necessary.
 Part C: To make this survey available for all users I uploaded the code into GitHib and Azure. Before uploading it to both applications, I made sure that my code was not private so others could view it and take the survey if they want.
